#17 23.81 
#17 23.81 curl performs SSL certificate verification by default, using a "bundle"
#17 23.81  of Certificate Authority (CA) public keys (CA certs). If the default

#17 23.81  using the --cacert option.
#17 23.81 If this HTTPS server uses a certificate signed by a CA represented in

#17 23.81  problem with the certificate (it might be expired, or the name might

#17 23.81 If you'd like to turn off curl's verification of the certificate, use
